This is the plan for my blog page
The body of the homepage will display the latest blog post
Blog posts will be saved as local txt files, then imported via javascript
The new-post page will include a form to create and save a blogpost, then save to a txt file
The post page will display all blog post titles with date and time, and will include view, edit and delete buttons
